Report: <http://varianceexplained.org/r/trump-tweets/>

-   Multiple research questions that culminate in one final conclusion
-   Consistent coloring to distinguish between iPhone and Android category
-   Included R code in his final website (may be distracting to a general audience)
-   Inconsistent formatting of visualizations
-   Lots of visualizations that correspond to different questions (variety of viz types as well)
-   The conclusion is well-supported by the visualizations, nothing seems unrelated
